# nethackrc
My [NetHack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetHack) configuration files for various versions (3.4.3, [3.4.3-nao](https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/Nethack.alt.org#NetHack_3.4.3_NAO), 3.6.2). I play as [chordbug on nethack.alt.org](https://alt.org/nethack/plr.php?player=chordbug).

`make` uses `parts/*[456]` to create `parts/*.g` and then `*.rc`. This repository includes output for convenience.
